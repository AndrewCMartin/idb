### What can we do better?
+++
- Filtering
  - Could be handling multiple requests inefficiently
  - Could also not be handling requests at all after a certain amount
+++
- Design
  - Make the functionality more like the official website
  - Add movie trailers and twitter feeds wherever possible
+++
- Nav Bar
  - When the screen size is neither large or small, the navbar extends to two lines
  - The search bar goes to the second line

  - Trailers to the Movie and TV Show instance pages
  - Twitter feeds for Actors
  - Refactoring the website to work on mobile devices

### What puzzles us?

## Other Critique

Canvas Group 17 - Board Game DB

---

### What did they do well?

+++
- Pleasing design
  - Minimalistic and simple
  - Neat and well-organized
+++
- [Global search & drop-down menu](http://boardgamedb.me/)
  - Looks very professional
  - Very nice to use
+++
- Navigation
  - Smooth transitions
  - Some links connect to other sites

---

### What did we learn from their website?
+++
- More to board games than we previously thought
  - [Massive events](http://boardgamedb.me/events?per_page=18&sort=name&page=1) are held
  - Different kinds of board games are created

+++
- The way the genres of board games have changed over time

---

### What can they do better?
+++
- Instance pages
  - Some pages we had to [scroll a lot](http://boardgamedb.me/genre/1002)
  - Hard to go through

+++
- Navigation
  - Some links were broken
  - Like [this one](http://boardgamedb.me/boardgamecategory/2726/age-reason)
  
+++
- Code
  - The APIs could have been created using Flask-Restless
  - Would have eliminated having to manually create jsons

---

### What puzzles us about their website?
+++
- Design
  - It is a bit plain for a board game site
+++
- Pagination
  - [18 per page](http://boardgamedb.me/games?per_page=18&sort=name&page=1)
  - Have to scroll quite a bit to reach the pagination bar
  - Would have been nice to either have the pagination bar at the top, or have fewer results per page

---


## Visualization
+++
- We created a visualization of Board Game DB's website
  - We created a stacked area chart using NVD3
  - The number of board games that were created each year are plotted against time

+++
- The visualisation shows how the genres of board games have changed over time
