## Self Critique

---

# What did we do well?

+++
- Good design that fits our topic
  - Which is instantly apparent to the user
  - Good balance: semi-minimalistic yet detailed
+++
- Easy to navigate
  - Navigation bar seen on all pages
  - Recognizable links on every page
+++
- Fun to see how everything connects
  - So its fun and easy to learn/explore everything Marvel
  
---

# What did we learn?

+++
## Technically
+++

- Scraping from the API

+++
- Using various tools we've never known before
  - React-Bootstrap
  - Postman
  - SQLAlchemy
  - GCP
  - And more
+++

- Hosting/managing the website

+++

- Integrating JavaScript and CSS
- Working with a database

---

## Other

+++
- Working in a large team
  - Planning schedules
  - Dividing the work
+++
- Working simultaneously
  - GitHub!
  - Also dealing with git conflicts
+++
- Seeing how things connect in Marvel
  - Similarities between comic characters and movie characters
  - Learning something before watching Thor: Ragnarok

---

# What can we do better?
+++
- Filtering
  - Works well at first, but then just stops
  - Could be handling multiple requests inefficiently
  - Could also NOT be handling requests at all after a certain amount
+++
- Design
  - Make it more like the official website

---

# What puzzles us?
+++
- Loading speed
  - Filtering and sorting are slow
+++
- Specifically searching
  - Does what it needs to do
  - But sometimes takes a long time

### Other Critique

Canvas Group 17

---

# What did they do well?

+++
- Pleasing design
  - Minimalistic and simple
  - Neat and well-organized
+++
- [Global search & drop-down menu](http://boardgamedb.me/)
  - Looks very professional
  - Very nice to use
+++
- Navigation
  - Smooth transitions
  - Some links connect to other sites

---

# What did we learn from their website?
+++
- More to board games than previously thought
  - [Massive events](http://boardgamedb.me/events?per_page=18&sort=name&page=1) are held
  - Different kinds of board games are created

---

# What can they do better?
+++
- Instance pages
  - Some pages we had to [scroll a lot](http://boardgamedb.me/genre/1002)
  - Hard to go through
+++
- Model pages
  - [18 per page](http://boardgamedb.me/games?per_page=18&sort=name&page=1)
  - So must scroll a while to get to the pagination bar
+++
- Navigation
  - Some links were broken
  - Like [this one](http://boardgamedb.me/boardgamecategory/2726/age-reason)

---

# What puzzles us about their website?
+++
- Design
  - It's a bit plain for a board game site
+++
- Pagination
  - Why choose 18 results per page if you still have to scroll quite a bit?
+++
- API
  - JSON responses aren't correctly formatted?
  - Returning an empty dict
