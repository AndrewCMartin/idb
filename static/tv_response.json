            "overview": "The Marvel Super Heroes is an American and Canadian-made animated television series starring five comic-book superheroes from Marvel Comics. It was first syndicated, on U.S. television, in 1966.\n\nProduced by Grantray-Lawrence Animation, headed by Grant Simmons, Ray Patterson and Robert Lawrence, it was an umbrella series of five segments, each approximately seven minutes long, broadcast on local television stations that aired the show at different times. The series ran initially as a half-hour program made up of three seven-minute segments of a single superhero, separated by a short description of one of the other four heroes. It has also been broadcast as a mixture of various heroes in a half-hour timeslot, and as individual segments as filler or within a children's TV program.\n\nThe segments, and their original rotations, were:\n\n⁕Monday: Captain America\n\n⁕Tuesday: The Incredible Hulk\n\n⁕Wednesday: The Invincible Iron Man\n\n⁕Thursday: The Mighty Thor\n\n⁕Friday: Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner",
